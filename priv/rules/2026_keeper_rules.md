**338 Rules for 2025-26 Keeper Season**

**1. Season**

The 2025-2026 338 Season includes sports with championships between August 1 2025 and July 31, 2026. There are 14 permanent sports and a 15th sport that changes each year.

Permanent sports are: NCAA Football, NFL, NCAA Basketball, NBA, NCAA Hockey, NHL, NCAA Baseball, MLB, Champions League, Kentucky Derby, PGA, LLWS, Men's and Women's Tennis.

In 2025-26, the rotating sport will be the Men's Soccer World Cup. Subsequent years are to be determined but may include: Women's College Basketball, Rugby World Cup Olympic Men's 3000m Steeplechase.

**2. Ownership**

Teams are allowed to have multiple owners and split the entry fee and winnings any way they choose.

For league voting purposes, each team will only receive one vote, regardless of number of owners.

Owners are not allowed to own or have partial ownership in multiple 338 teams in the same league, but may own or have partial ownership in teams in different leagues.

If relegation/promotion puts 2 teams with the same owner or partial owner in the same league, owner(s) may drop ownership stake to a single team or else the lower ranked team(s) will be pushed down a league until all owners have a stake in only one team/league.

**3. Rosters**

Each Owner has 20 roster slots with one slot dedicated to each sport (15 slots) and 5 slots open to any sport. Roster slots may be left open at any time. All roster slots count for league points (ie Flex Spots are active and not bench spots).

**Tennis/Golf**

You do not have to use the same player throughout the year. 2 players used in the same tournament will require 2 roster slots, but waivering/trading players for each tournament is allowed and the scores will be combined. If using multiple roster slots, Owner must declare which slot a newly acquired player will be in (separate from roster slots). Owners cannot use the same player in multiple slots, unless 2 or more rostered players have been used in the same slot in different tournaments. In that case, the owner may choose which slot both players go in order is determined by the highest ranked player at the time of acquisition going into the roster slot with the most points. If a player is put on IR and replaced for a tournament, the injured player will still be considered to have occupied the slot for that event, not the replacement player.

**Example Scenario**

I have Tiger and Phil for The Masters, then trade them both for Rory and Scott prior to PGA. I must declare which players will be combined before the event. I choose #1-Tiger/Scott & #2-Phil/Rory. For the US Open, I trade Rory for Tiger and drop Scott for Stenson, making the combo #1-Tiger/Scott/Tiger & #2-Phil/Rory/Stenson. Then I claim Scott for British Open, keeping Tiger & Stenson. At time of claim, rankings are: #1-Scott, #3-Tiger, #7-Stenson. Combo becomes #1-Tiger/Scott/Tiger/Scott, #2-Phil/Rory/Stenson/Tiger, #3-Stenson. Stenson would remain in 2 but I could choose Tiger or Scott for slot 1 and the other would go in slot 3.

**Injured Reserve**

Each Owner will have one IR slot per individual sport (MT, WT, PGA). If a player withdraws from an event prior to the start, Owner may move the player to IR and claim a new player, maintaining ownership of the injured player. This will not cost a waiver claim, but the replacement player will be automatically dropped at the end of the tournament.

IR claims may be submitted at any time before the start of each tournament but are processed in the order submitted after the waiver deadline, giving priority to waiver claims. IR claims must be submitted prior to the start of the tournament.

If a player is suspended for rules violation or does not qualify for an event, the player is not eligible for IR and must be replaced by a waiver claim.

**4. Keepers**

Up to 3 players may be designated as keepers at the start of the draft. In order to be eligible to designated as a keeper, a player must:

1.  Have been drafted in rounds 2-20 in the previous draft
2.  Can not have been claimed on waivers at any point during the season
3.  Be in one of the 14 permanent sports

A keeper will be redrafted one round earlier than the player was selected in the previous draft. If an owner does not have a pick in that round, the player will move to the owner's next available pick in a lower round. If an owner has multiple keepers in the same round but only 1 pick, they can select which player will be taken in an earlier round. If an owner has multiple picks in a round with a keeper, the keeper will be selected with the later pick .

**5. Entry Fee**

Entry fee of $250 due by Nov 1st, 2025. Late payment may result in single sport disqualification(s) at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Entry fees and payouts only accepted from one user, regardless of number of co-owners per team.

**6. Scoring**

Points are awarded to the top 8 of each sport. 8 points for winning the league, 5 points for runner-up, 3 points for reaching the semifinals, and 1 point for reaching the quarterfinals. See individual sport for details. If any team/player is later stripped of a standing, prior to relegation, due to violation of any kind, points will be adjusted. Any violation and resulting standings change post-relegation will have no impact on the 338.

**Tennis**

Tennis-only points are awarded for each of the 4 Grand Slam Events, immediately after the tournament. 1st=8, 2nd=5, SF=3, QF=1. Negative 2 points awarded to a Top 8 Seed losing in the 1st round and Negative 1 point for a Top 8 Seed losing in the 2nd round. If match is a walkover or player retires before the completion of the first set, negative points will not apply. Tennis points will be tallied individually, to an assigned tennis slot, which are separate from Roster spots (e.g. Tennis-1, Tennis-2, etc). If a player is traded or dropped, the Owner retains any points they have earned as long as another player occupies that slot at the end of the season.

**Example Scenario**

I have Djokovic who wins the Aussie Open, scoring me 8 pts. I trade him for Nadal prior to the French Open. Nadal wins, so I now have 16 pts. If I had kept Djokovic and traded for Nadal prior to the French Open, then Nadal beats Djokovic, I would have 13 pts for my first Tennis slot (Djokovic Aussie W + FO 2nd place) and 8 pts for my second slot (Nadal FO W). League pts awarded to top 8 total scores.

OWNER may have multiple places in the top 8 but must have a player in each roster slot qualifying for league points. Owner must score at least 1 point to be eligible

**Golf**

Golf-only points are awarded for each of the 4 majors, immediately after the tournament: 1st=50, 2nd=40, 3rd-35th=37,36,35â€¦6,5,3 36th-40th =3, made cut =1, missed cut= -5. If a player is disqualified or withdraws in the 1st or 2nd round, it will be considered a missed cut. Golf points will be tallied to an assigned golf slot (e.g. PGA-1, PGA-2, etc). If a player is traded or dropped, the Owner retains any points they have earned.

**Example Scenario**

I have Tiger and Phil. Tiger wins the Masters (50pts) and Phil finishes 11th (29pts). I keep Tiger but drop Phil and Tiger wins the US Open. I now have 100pts for Tiger and still have 29pts for Phil. Prior to the British Open, I pick up Rory and still have Tiger. Rory wins and Tiger misses the cut. I now have 95 pts for Tiger and 79 pts combined for Phil/Rory. Following the four majors League points will be awarded to top 8 total scores. OWNER may have multiple places in the top 8 but must have a player in each roster slot qualifying for league points. Owner must score at least 1 point to be eligible

**Tennis/Golf League Points**

Players may be dropped and traded throughout the year, resulting in multiple players earning points. Rosters will lock after the final major's deadline and in order for league points to be earned, a roster slot must be occupied by that sport for the number of players earning points the scoring roster slot must be occupied by a player in that sport. If an owner finishes in the top 8 but does not have a player in the roster slot to earn those points, the slot will not count in the final standings and others will move up.

**Example Scenario**

If I have Djokovic and Nadal and they finish first and second in tennis, I must have 2 roster slots occupied by men's tennis players in order to earn league points. If I traded or dropped one of them and filled the roster slot with a different sport, I would only earn league points for one player the Tennis Slot the rostered player occupies. The 3rd place owner would then move up to 2nd, 4th to 3rd and so on.

**Tie Breakers: Individual Sport**

Tennis and golf points League points for Tennis and Golf will be split evenly among tied Owners at the end of the final major. Single event golf points awarded in full to each tied owner. Money split for 1st or 2nd place tie. League: Owners will split the winnings evenly. Relegation: See Below.

**7. Payout** ***subject to change pending final owner count**

**League A:**

-   1st: $1000
-   2nd: $750
-   3rd: $550
-   4th: $400
-   5th: $275

**Single Sport Payouts**

1st: $25 2nd: $10. If an un-owned team finishes 1st or 2nd, money goes into league pot and divided equally among other money winners. If Owners tie in league standings, money is split evenly.

**Payments**

Payments will only be sent to one user, regardless of the number of owners per team.

**8. Waiver Wire**

Originally set by reverse draft order. A successful claim drops you to the bottom. All non-rostered players are on waivers. Waiver claims are made by submission via the site's Waivers Page. Select the player you want and hit submit. The league will be notified and there will be a 3-day waiting period where any other Owner may also claim the player.

Claims process exactly 72 hours after the original claim (except at deadlines, see below), regardless of how many other owners put a claim in. At the 72-hour mark, the Owner with the highest waiver priority will be awarded the player and must roster the player.

If no valid roster slots are available, the claim will process as invalid and go to the next Owner. If the Waiver deadline has already passed, a player in that sport may NOT be dropped, even if in the same sport as the player being claimed, unless claim/drop was entered prior to the deadline and processes after.

Players to be dropped may be adjusted and Claims may be canceled at any time during the wait period.

**Waiting Periods**

Waiting Period is waived near the deadline for Steeplechase, College Basketball, College Hockey, Kentucky Derby, and LLWS. Due to the conference tournaments ending just before CBB and CHK brackets are announced, there will be no waiver period on claims in CBB and CHK. Instead, we will have a 1-week "quiet period" prior to the deadline. Claims will be announced to the league but players hidden and will process at the deadline based on waiver position. Claims submitted prior to the start of the quiet period will process in the standard 3 days.

Extra draft picks at the end of KD & LLWS will be up for waiver claim until the individual draft begins. At that point, remaining draft picks and/or remaining players after the draft may be claimed with no waiting period.

All waiver claims submitted within 48 hours of the deadline will process at 11:59 pm Pacific the day after the deadline.

**Golf/Tennis**

Owners do NOT receive credit for points earned in tournaments prior to waiver pickup. Players may be dropped without a pick-up, leaving an open roster slot to be filled later. One roster slot must be dedicated to each sport and cannot be filled with a player from a different sport. Flex spots can be filled with players from any sport.

**Waiver Deadline**

See each sport for waiver deadlines. After the deadline NO players may be claimed or dropped from roster, except for late drops and pending claims in the waiting period.

After the deadline, there will be an email sent with teams Any players that were dropped within 12 hours of deadline or dropped after a successful claim are eligible for claim for 24 hours after the deadline or drop time, whichever is later, and Owners will have an opportunity to claim them. This eliminates holding a player until the last minute to keep others from claiming. This also allows an Owner that put in a claim, but was trumped by a higher waiver to claim another player.

**9. Trades**

Trades of players and future round draft picks are allowed. Trades are submitted to another owner from the roster page. If the trade is accepted, the league will be notified. Trades are ineligible if they break any 338 rules stated herein or include any non-338 assets.

There will be a 3-day voting period needing a majority Yes votes to pass. If an owner does not submit a vote during the voting period it will be considered an approval.

Once a trade is submitted and the other owner accepts, the involved Owners are agreeing to the trade and may not make changes or vote against it unless all involved agree.

Future Round Draft Picks may be traded, but only for the next draft to take place (if mid-draft, trades apply to that draft) and must be 1:1 (Owner-A trades 1st round pick to Owner-B for a player and 5th round pick.)

Waiver position may be traded in the current season only.

Only one condition or escalation may be included on each trade. If an escalation results in picks owed that have been included in multiple trades, the later trade will escalate to the next available pick.

If an open roster slot is unavailable for a player being traded, the owner must add in the notes which player will be dropped to create roster space if the trade is approved. If no player is noted to be dropped, the trade will be declared invalid.

**Golf/Tennis**

Points already earned by players that are traded stay with the former Owner.

**Trade Deadline**

See Championships page for deadlines. After the trade deadline NO players for that sport may be traded. If an owner submits a trade proposal on the site prior to the deadline, but the 2nd owner does not accept it until the following morning, the trade will be valid. If not accepted by Noon PT after the trade deadline, it will be invalid.

**Keeper Rights**

Keeper rights to eligible players may be traded after the deadline but the player will continue to be rostered by the current owner until the end of the season.

**10. Draft**

Draft order determined by random draw, with Owners placed in one bucket and draft position placed in a different bucket. The draft is conducted via website in Snake style. For sports that have a smaller number of teams (e.g. KD, LLWS), every member must be able to draft a team from a league. Once the limit has been reached, only members without a team from that league will be allowed to draft from that sport. Once a draft pick has been emailed to the league, it cannot be changed.

**Time Limit**

Each Owner will have a cumulative total of 25 hours to make all 20 picks. There is no time limit for each pick. If an Owner exceeds 25 hours in total, the draft queue must be utilized to make picks. If the draft queue is empty, the Owner is able to manually enter a pick, but the site will proceed with the draft and allow the next Owner to enter their pick.

Hours from 11pm - 6am local time will not count against draft time. If an owner is on the clock overnight, those hours will be deducted the following day by the commish. Default local time for each team is PST unless the team provides another time zone to the commish. Each team can identify one local time zone and cannot change it during the draft.

**10. In-Season Drafts**

Some sports will include a secondary draft in-season. During the main League Draft, you will select a draft position rather than a specific player (i.e. With my first round pick in the League draft, I select the First Pick of the Kentucky Derby). The following sports will have a secondary in-season draft:

**Kentucky Derby**

Draft will take place on race day, time TBD. There will be a 5 minute time limit per pick. After 5 minutes, if a pick is not in the draft queue and owner has not entered a pick they will be skipped. A skipped owner may pick at any time after that, but cannot take a horse already drafted. Draft limited to 18 horses so in the event of a late scratch Owner will be able to replace horse. If a horse is scratched after being drafted, a replacement may be picked at the completion of the draft and it will NOT count as a waiver claim. If multiple horses are scratched, replacements are chosen in original draft order.

**LLWS**

The draft for the LLWS will be Sunday August 11th. There will be a 5 minute time limit per pick. After 5 minutes, if a pick is not in the draft queue and owner has not entered a pick they will be skipped. A skipped owner may pick at any time after that, but cannot take a team already drafted. There are only 20 teams in the LLWS.

**11. Official Season**

In order for the season to be official and payouts made, 8 sports must be completed or have the league name official results by July 20th, 2026. If 8 or more sports are canceled or delayed beyond July 20th, the 338 season will be canceled and all entry fees refunded with no winnings paid out. Trades of future draft picks will also be canceled.

If a sport is canceled or delayed beyond July 20th 2026, no points will be awarded unless the league officially names a champion. All trades will be valid.

In the event that a sport does not complete the season and the league declares an official champion but not a clear 2nd â€“ 8th, the 338 will use the following rankings to award league points:

-   MLB â€“ 5 pts to best record in other league, 3 points to 2nd best record in each league and 1 pt to 3rd division leader and best record for a non-division leader. If the top 2 teams are in the same division, then 1 point to other 2 division leaders.
-   CFB â€“ AP Poll
-   NFL â€“ 5 pts to best record in other conference, 3 points to 2nd best record in each conference and 1 pt to 3rd & 4th best records in each conference.
-   CBK â€“ AP Poll
-   NBA â€“ 5 pts to best record in other conference, 3 points to 2nd best record in each conference and 1 pt to 3rd & 4th best records in each conference.
-   CHK â€“ Pairwise
-   NHL â€“ â€“ 5 pts to best record in other conference, 3 points to 2nd best record in each conference and 1 pt to 3rd & 4th best records in each conference.
-   NCAA Baseball â€“ D1Baseball.com Rankings
-   Champions League â€“ points split among tied teams

Exceptions: If a league has partially completed the postseason at the time of cancellation/suspension, actual results will be used.

In order for PGA, MT and WT results to count in league play, at least 2 events must be completed by July 20th 2026
