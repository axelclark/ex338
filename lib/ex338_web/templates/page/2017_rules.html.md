# 338 Rules for 2017 Season

1. **Season:** The 2017 338 Season includes only sports with Championship game/series occurring in calendar year 2017.

2. **Rosters:** Each Owner has 20 roster slots with one slot dedicated to each sport (14 slots) and 6 slots open to any sport.  Roster slots may be left open at any time.

  1. **Tennis/Golf:** You do not have to use the same player throughout the year.  2 players used in the same tournament will require 2 roster slots, but waivering/trading players for each tournament is allowed and the scores will be combined.  If using multiple roster slots, Owner must declare which slot a newly acquired player will be in.  Owners cannot use the same player in multiple slots, unless 2 or more rostered players have been used in the same slot.  In that case, order is determined by the highest ranked player at the time of acquisition going into the roster slot with the most points.  EX: I have Tiger and Phil for The Masters, then trade them both for Rory and Scott prior to US Open.  I must declare which players will be combined before the event.  I choose Tiger/Scott &amp; Phil/Rory.  For the British Open, I trade Rory for Tiger and drop Scott for Stenson, making the combo Tiger/Scott/Tiger &amp; Phil/Rory/Stenson.  Then I claim Scott for PGA, keeping Tiger &amp; Stenson.  At time of claim, rankings are: #1-Scott, #3-Tiger, #7-Stenson.  Combo becomes Tiger/Scott/Tiger/Scott, Phil/Rory/Stenson/Tiger, Stenson.

  2. **Injured Reserve:**  ** ** Each Owner will have one IR slot per individual sport (MT, WT, PGA).  If a player withdraws from an event prior to the start for any reason, Owner may move the player to IR and claim a new player.  This will not cost a waiver claim, but the replacement player will be automatically dropped at the end of the tournament.  IR claims are processed after the waiver deadline, giving priority to waiver claims.  IR claims must be submitted prior to the start of the tournament.  If a player is suspended or does not qualify for an event, IR does not apply and the player must be replaced by a waiver claim.

3. **Entry Fee:** League A: $200 League B: $225 Payment due by Dec 1st, 2016. **Late payment may result in single sport disqualification(s) at the discretion of Dooley.  Dooley has absolutely no mercy so expect it to**  **happen and don&#39;t bitch about it.  You had 2.5 months to pay and didn&#39;t.  You are a loser.  No one cares when losers complain.**

4. **Scoring:** Points are awarded to the top 8 of each sport. 8 points for winning the league, 5 points for runner-up, 3 points for reaching the semifinals, and 1 point for reaching the quarterfinals. See individual sport for details.  If any team/player is later stripped of a standing, prior to relegation, due to violation of any kind, points will be adjusted.  Any violation and resulting standings change post-relegation will have no impact on the 338.

  1. **College Football:** Top 4 teams will be determined by playoffs.  The 4 highest ranked teams in the final AP Poll who are not in the playoffs will each get 1 point.

  2. **Tennis:** Tennis-only points are awarded for each of the 4 Grand Slam Events, immediately after the tournament.  1st=8, 2nd=5, SF=3, QF=1. Negative 2 points awarded to a Top 8 Seed losing in the 1st round and Negative 1 point for a Top 8 Seed losing in the 2nd round.  Tennis points will be tallied individually, to a specific roster slot.  If a player is traded or dropped, the Owner retains any points they have earned.  EX: I have Djokovic who wins the Aussie Open, scoring me 8 pts.  I trade him for Nadal prior to the French Open.  Nadal wins, so I now have 16 pts.  If I had kept Djokovic and traded for Nadal prior to the French Open, then Nadal beats Djokovic, I would have 13 pts for my first Tennis slot (Djokovic Aussie W + FO 2nd place) and 8 pts for my second slot (Nadal FO W).  League pts awarded to top 8 total scores (OWNER may have multiple places in the top 8.  Owner must score at least 1 point to be eligible).

  3. **Golf:**  Golf-only points are awarded for each of the 4 majors, immediately after the tournament: 1st=50, 2nd=40, 3rd-35th=37,36,35...6,5, 36th-40th =3, made cut =1, missed cut= -5.  Golf points will be tallied individually, to a specific roster slot.  If a player is traded or dropped, the Owner retains any points they have earned.  EX: I have Tiger and Phil.  Tiger wins the Masters (50pts) and Phil finishes 11th (29pts).  I keep Tiger but drop Phil and Tiger wins the US Open. I now have 100pts for Tiger and still have 29pts for Phil.  Prior to the British Open, I pick up Rory and still have Tiger. Rory wins and Tiger misses the cut.  I now have 95 pts for Tiger and 79 pts combined for Phil/Rory.  Following the four majors League points will be awarded to top 8 total scores.  Each Owner may have multiple places in the top 8.  Owner must score at least 1 pt to be eligible.

  4. **Tennis/Golf League Points:** Players may be dropped and traded throughout the year, resulting in multiple players earning points.  <span class="highlight"> Rosters will lock after the final major&#39;s deadline and in order for league points to be earned, a roster slot must be occupied by that sport for the number of players earning points.</span>  Ex: If I have Djokovic and Nadal and they finish first and second in tennis, I must have 2 roster slots occupied by men&#39;s tennis players in order to earn league points.  If I traded or dropped one of them and filled the roster slot with a different sport, I would only earn league points for one player.

  5. **Tie Breakers:** _Individual Sport_: Points awarded evenly to tied Owners.  Money split for 1st or 2nd place tie.    _League_:  Owners will split the winnings evenly.  _Relegation: _ See Below.

5. **Payout:** (assumes 14 in A, 14 in B)

  1. **League A:**
    - 1st: $995
    - 2nd:$750
    - 3rd: $450
    - 4th: $300
    - 5th: $200
  2. **League B:**
    - 1st: $800
    - 2nd:$600
    - 3rd: $400
    - 4th: $275
    - 5th: $200

  **Single Sport Payouts:**  1st: $25  2nd: $10.  If an un-owned team finishes 1st or 2nd, money goes into league pot. If Owners tie, money is split evenly.

6. **Waiver Wire:** Originally set by reverse draft order. A successful claim drops you to the bottom. All non-rostered teams are on waivers. <span class="highlight">Waiver claims are submitted via the Fantasy Team page. Select the team/player (player) you want to add and/or drop and hit submit. Owners can submit three types of waivers:  add a player and drop a player (drop is only made if the add is successful), only drop a player, or only add a player. The league will be notified via email when the claim is submitted and the waiver will be listed as pending on the site.</span>

  There will be a 3-day waiting period when any other Owner may claim the added player by submitting a new waiver for that player. <span class="highlight">“Drop only” waivers have no waiting period and are processed immediately.  If a roster positions is not available on the team at the time the claim is submitted (and a player to drop is not included), the claim is invalid and will be cancelled by the commish.  An owner may change the player to drop during the 3-day waiting period by messaging the commish or updating the claim via the site (this feature to be added in the future.)</span>

  <span class="highlight">At the end of the 3-day period, new claims for that player will no longer be accepted and the commish will process the claim.  The Owner with the highest waiver priority (i.e. lowest waiver position) will have the player added to its roster by the commish.</span>  Once submitted, a claim may not be cancelled by the claiming Owner.

  Waiting Period is waived during certain times for College Basketball, College Hockey, Kentucky Derby and LLWS.  Due to the conference tournaments ending just before CBB and CHK brackets are announced, there will be no wait period on claims in CBB and CHK.  Instead, we will have a 1 week &quot;quiet period&quot; prior to the deadline.  Claims will not be announced to the league and will process at the deadline based on waiver position.  Extra draft picks at the end of KD &amp; LLWS will be up for waiver claim until the individual draft begins.  At that point, remaining draft picks may be claimed with no waiting period.  _Golf/Tennis_: Owners do NOT receive credit for points earned in tournaments prior to waiver pickup.  Teams may be dropped without a pick-up, leaving an open roster slot to be filled later.  One roster slot must be dedicated to each sport.

  1. **Waiver Deadline:** See each sport for waiver deadlines. After the deadline NO TEAMS may be claimed or dropped from roster, **except** for late drops.  After the deadline, there will be a an email sent with teams that were dropped within 12 hours of deadline or dropped after a successful claim and Owners will have an opportunity to claim them.  This eliminates holding a team until the last minute to keep others from claiming.  This also allows an Owner that put in a claim, but was trumped by a higher waiver to claim another team. <span class="highlight">For sports with multiple championships, waivers will be closed for that sport between each championship waiver deadline and the championship.  After the championship, waivers for the sport will reopen.</span>

7. **Trades:** Trades are submitted to Commish and if eligible, presented to the league.  Trades are ineligible if they break any 338 rules stated herein or include any non-338 assets.  There will be a 3-day voting period needing 8 Yes votes to pass. A no-response during the voting period will be considered an approval.  Once a trade is submitted for Commish approval, the involved Owners are agreeing to the trade and may not make changes or vote against it unless all involved agree. Future Round Draft Picks may be traded, but only for the adjacent season&#39;s draft and must be 1:1 (Owner-A trades 1st round pick to Owner-B for team and 5th round pick.)

  1. **Golf/Tennis:** Points already earned by players that are traded stay with the former Owner.

  2. **Trade Deadline:** See each sport for trade deadlines. After the deadline NO TEAMS for that sport may be traded.

  3. **Future Round Draft Picks:** Deadline for trading draft picks is the current season MLB trade deadline.

8. **Draft:** Draft order determined using [http://www.random.org/lists](http://www.random.org/lists). Conducted via website in Snake style. For leagues that have a smaller number of teams (e.g. KD, LLWS), every member must be able to draft a team from a league. Once the limit has been reached, only members without a team from that league will be allowed to draft from that sport.  Once a draft pick has been emailed to the league, it cannot be changed.

  1. **Kentucky Derby:** The draft for the Kentucky Derby will be held in May once the field is announced. During the September draft, you will be selecting a draft position rather than an actual horse. (For example, you may use your 4th round selection for the first pick in the Kentucky Derby draft).  Draft limited to 18 horses in case of a late scratch, Owner will be able to replace horse.  If a horse is scratched after being drafting, a replacement may be picked at the completion of the draft and it will NOT count as a waiver claim.  If multiple horses are scratched, replacements are chosen in original draft order.  The first pick must be made by 8:30 AM PST on Friday before the race.  If not made by 8:30, the OWNER with Pick #2 may draft and so on.  Owner with #1 may pick at any time after that, but cannot take a horse already drafted.

  2. **LLWS:** The draft for the LLWS will begin in August, after the regional winners are set. During the September draft, you will be selecting a draft position rather than an actual team (For example, you may use your 4th round selection for the first pick in the LLWS draft). There are only 16 teams in the LLWS.

9. **Relegation:** Based on League Points, the bottom 4 Owners in A will be relegated to League B and the top 4 Owners in B will move up to A.  Because relegation and the 2018 draft will take place prior to the end of the MLB season, we will use the MLB regular season standings at the end of the day on the day of the US Open Men&#39;s final.  This is for relegation purposes only_.  League points will still be based on the playoffs.

  1. For relegation, points will be awarded based on the following:

    * 8 pts: Best Overall Record
    * 5 pts: Best Overall Record in other league
    * 3 pts: 2nd Best Record in each league:
    * 1 pt: 3rd division leader + best overall record of non-division leader.  If top 2 teams are in same division, then 1 point to other 2 division leaders.

  2. **TIEBREAKERS (in order of application):**

    * MLB_: Run Differential, Record in September, Head-to-Head Record, Coin Flip
    * LEAGUE_: # of championships, # of teams scoring league points, lowest drafted team to score a league point (excludes waiver claims and trades).

  3. **DRAFT PICK TRADES:** If relegation results in Owners that traded draft picks in different leagues, the traded picks will take place at the end of the round.  EX: I trade my 1st round pick away and get a 10th round pick in return and I get relegated to B.  The Owner I traded with would get my 1st round pick at the end of the 1st round.  I would get the 10th round pick I traded for at the end of the 10th round.  If both teams involved in the trade stay in the same league, or both get relegated, they would swap actual picks.  If multiple Owners have supplemental picks, the order will be in reverse of the picks in that round.

  4. **END OF SEASON** If an Owners gets relegated from A to B, but finishes in the money in League A after actual MLB results are recorded, that Owner will automatically move up to A (after their relegation season) as the #1 team, regardless of actual position in B.   If an Owner finishes in the top 10 in A, but does not play the following season, the 11th place Owner will remain in A and a new Owner will be added to B.
