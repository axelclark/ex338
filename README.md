# Ex338

A web application to manage the 338 Challenge Fantasy League built using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
and [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/). The 338 Challenge is a
fantasy sports league where you pick teams instead of players and get points
when your team wins its league championship.

The draft, waivers, and trades are accomplished through the website. The league
is set up to have multiple divisions (with relegation).
